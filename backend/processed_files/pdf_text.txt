Developer 
Skills Report
Insights based on 116,648 developers
At HackerRank, we have over 7 million developers in our community. 
That’s over 25% of the world’s developers who are using HackerRank 
to level up their coding skills. 
We’re fortunate to play a part in expanding and growing the developer 
community during this time of rapid change. Our mission at HackerRank 
is to help accelerate the world’s innovation as more and more 
companies shift to tech-focused approaches to running and building 
their businesses. Since 2010, 22 newcomers have entered the Fortune 
100—a seismic shift—driven largely by technical innovation. Since that 
time, tech-first giants like Amazon, Google, and Facebook have joined 
the list, and they’re not slowing down.
As companies evolve to embed tech into the heart of their products, 
the need for skilled talent is growing exponentially. To meet that 
demand, companies will have to become experts in developer hiring—
not by relying on developers’ pedigrees or resumes, but by objectively 
evaluating their skills and placing them strategically throughout the 
organizations they work for.
To understand the state of developer skills in 2020, we’re launching our third annual 
Developer Skills Report: the largest survey of its kind ever released. We asked for 
input on coding bootcamps, pay equity, and more—and over 116,000 developers 
from 162 countries responded. The data provides unparalleled insight into what 
employers and employees know, what they’re looking for in their work, and how 
they see their roles evolving as technology sweeps across industries of all sizes.
I hope you enjoy our findings. Please feel free to tweet us @hackerrank 
or email us at research@hackerrank.com with comments or questions.

Under the age of 39? Odds are that most of your peers learned 
to code in C.
Most Baby Boomers and Gen Xers—or, those between the ages 
of 40 and 74 in 2020—learned to code in BASIC. Developed for 
educational use in 1964, BASIC was a popular instructional 
language in college classrooms.
But that began to change in 1972, when Bell Labs invented C, 
allowing portability of  the Unix operating system. Though it wasn’t 
an instant hit, the language rose to popularity in the late 70s 
and early 80s alongside the growth of Unix. 
Today, the language is celebrated for its longevity, flexibility, 
and ease of use—just some of the reasons it’s still popular 
for Gen Zers learning to code today.
For learning to code, 
C is overtaking BASIC

Gen Z is more likely than any previous generation to learn coding skills 
from bootcamps. Nearly one in six say they’ve leveraged bootcamps 
to learn new skills.
On the flip side, they’re less likely to learn coding skills from older 
generations’ go-tos, like books and on-the-job training. As Gen Z 
comes to rely more heavily on non-traditional education sources 
like bootcamps, they’re poised to become a key talent pool.
So which coding bootcamps are they turning to? Among respondents,

Hiring managers are bringing on bootcamp grads: 32% of them have 
hired a developer who learned their coding skills from a bootcamp.
But not all hiring managers have tapped into this growing talent pool. 
Nearly half (49%) of hiring managers have never hired a bootcamp 
grad. Results were similar across all company sizes.
As younger generations are increasingly drawn to bootcamps, that 
mentality may have to change. Gen Z is more likely than previous 
generations to learn coding skills from a bootcamp, while bootcamp 
attendance rates have risen 11x over the last decade. Combined, it’s 
a signal that bootcamp grads are slated to grow in number—and may 
grow as a talent source as time goes on.
Nearly 1 in 3 hiring

Hiring managers that bring on bootcamp grads reap the benefits.
In fact: 72% of hiring managers that have hired a bootcamp grad felt 
they were equally or better equipped for the job than other hires. 
According to managers, the top reasons bootcamp grads exceed are:
• Ability to learn new technologies & languages quickly (71%)
• Strong practical experience (61%)
• Eager to take on new responsibilities (52%)
It’s a strong endorsement for this fast-growing form of coding 
education. While the first coding bootcamps emerged in 2011, their 
popularity has exploded over the course of the decade. A recent study 
counted 20,000+ bootcamp graduates in 2019  from 110 full-time 
programs—and that’s just in the United States (US) and Canada.
And hiring managers 
believe they’re well-

Tech hiring giants like Google, Apple, and IBM have famously lifted 
their 4-year degree requirements. But for hiring developers without 
degrees, it’s small companies that are leading the charge.
32% of developers at small companies (1-49 employees) haven’t 
obtained a Bachelor’s degree. It’s a stark contrast to large companies 
(10,000+ employees); there, 91% of developers have obtained 
a Bachelor’s degree or higher, while only 9% have not.
It’s a win for small companies, and should be seen as an opportunity 
for larger companies to tap into a broader talent pool.

Across company sizes, hiring managers agree that full-stack developers 
are top priority: 38% of hiring managers say it’s the #1 role to fill in 2020. 
Back-end developers and data scientists were ranked second and third 
priorities, respectively. 
The emphasis on full-stack developers was most pronounced in small 
companies (1-49 employees), 43% of which ranked the role as their 
top priority.
Though the qualities that define a “full-stack developer” are a subject 
of debate, most agree that they should have a basic understanding 
(or better) of all layers of a tech stack, and should be able to generate 
a minimum viable product on their own. It’s why they’re especially 
important in small organizations, where fewer employees often have
to do the job of many.

Full-stack developers may be in highest demand, but their role 
is also one of the most professionally demanding. 60% of full-stack 
developers were required to learn a completely new framework 
or platform in the last year—more than any other role polled.
Full-stack developers also have to learn the most languages: 
45% reported that they had to pick up a new one within the last year. 
Their peers have to learn more about  theoretical concepts; 
data scientists and DevOps engineers were required to learn new 
concepts most often (33%).
With expertise that spans front-end, back-end, and more (depending 
on whom you ask), full-stack developers have one of the more 
nebulous job descriptions in the technical world. The relative 
flexibility of their role—and the breadth of technologies they have 
to keep up on as a result—means learning on the job never stops.

Globally, JavaScript is the most popular language hiring managers 
look for in a candidate. But not all hiring managers see language 
skills as a top priority: globally, 14% say they’re language agnostic 
when screening candidates.
This trend is most pronounced in the Americas region (AMER): 
21% of hiring managers in the region are language agnostic 
when searching for new hires. Asia-Pacific region (APAC) hiring 
managers are half as likely to be language agnostic (10%).

In terms of most known languages, little has changed over the last three 
years. In fact, the top 10 languages saw only two changes from last year: 
C# and PHP switched between sixth and seventh position.
It’s worth noting that the best known language, JavaScript, isn’t 
a language most developers learn to code in—only 5% of respondents 
reported it as their first programming language. Java follows a similar 
pattern: it’s the second best known language overall, yet only 13% 
of developers say it was their first language learned.

This year, the framework landscape was as dynamic as last year, with five 
total changes across the top 10.
Since our first Developer Skills Survey, Vue.js, has shown steady growth, 
rising one spot per year since 2018. But the most dramatic change was for 
Django, which moved up two spots between 2019 and 2020  (rising from 
sixth to fourth most popular). 
Django’s lift in usage is inextricably linked to the rise of Python. A popular 
choice for machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Python saw an 
uptick in usage in 2019, and has consistently been ranked as one of the top 
languages that developers want to learn year over year. And since Django is 
a Python-based framework, it’s natural that Django would rise alongside it.

For the third year running, Go is the #1 language developers want 
to learn next. 
Developed by Google, Go has seen increasing popularity since 
its invention in 2009, due in part to the visibility of its creators. 
As we noted in our 2018 report, it’s not the first time tech giants 
like Google have driven language adoption: Twitter similarly 
boosted Scala when it outgrew Ruby on Rails, as Apple did for Swift 
when it moved away from Objective-C. 
And slowly but surely, developers are learning Go. It inched up 
to the 12th best known language for 2020, up from 13th in 2018.

Perl is the language most closely associated with above-average 
pay. Globally, developers that know Perl make 54% more than 
the average annual developer salary. It’s followed by Scala (+42%), 
and Go (+33%).
The high pay association with languages like Perl, Scala, and Go 
is due in part to the demographic that knows them. For example, 
about 10% of senior developers polled knew Perl—but only 2% 
of junior developers did. Scala and Go showed similar patterns. 
And since senior developers tend to earn higher salaries, 
the average salary associated with each language is elevated.

AngularJS and Django round out the top 3: 28% say they plan 
to learn AngularJS, and 26% say they’re learning Django. All three 
frameworks are in the top five that hiring managers need.
Last year, we noted that an increasing number of developers were

become the best known framework in 2020. But in this year’s survey, 
React’s position remained static as the second best-known framework.

Backbone.js is the framework associated with the highest pay: 
developers that know it earn 49% more than the global average. 
Cocoa and Ruby on Rails were linked to the second and third highest 
average salaries. Those that know Cocoa earn 35% more than 
the global average, whereas those that know Ruby on Rails earn 
30% more than the global average.
Again, the association with higher pay is tied in part to seniority. 
Take, for example, Backbone.js. 7% of senior developers know it, 
compared to only 2% of junior developers. And since senior 
developers earn higher pay, it could elevate the average pay linked 
to the framework.
It’s worth noting that Backbone.js is also an uncommon skill—
globally, only 4% of developers know it. So the low knowledge supply 
may allow those that know it to demand higher pay.

Taking a closer look at the US, western cities take the cake 
for highest developer salaries. Cities in the west have the highest 
pay (with an average salary of $128,198), while the northeast comes 
in second (with an average salary of about $112,871). 
High salaries in the west region are led by coastal tech talent 
magnets like San Francisco ($147,948), Seattle ($134,539), 
and Los Angeles ($129,080), which make up the three highest 
paying cities in the region. And in the northeast, Boston ($116,804) 
and New York ($115,792) pay the highest salaries. 
•  West Average: $128,198
•  Northeast Average: $112,871
•  Midwest Average: $100,711
•  South Average: $98,986

Only 35% of developers believe they’re being paid fairly. On the flip 
side, 39% believe they’re being paid unfairly compared to peers, 
and 26% just aren’t sure.
As sharing salaries has become the norm through websites like 
Glassdoor and LinkedIn, developers have gained unprecedented 
access to peer salary estimates. In many ways, that shift is a positive 
one; it gives developers the ammo they need to negotiate pay aligned 
with their fair market value. But it also means developers are more 
aware when their pay differs from that of their peer group.

Last year, we learned that competitive compensation is the #3 
criteria developers look for in a job—but professional growth 
and learning is #1. This year, we asked developers to define 
the form of professional growth that’s most important to them.
Most developers agree: they want opportunities to learn new 
technical skills on the job. A whopping 59% of developers ranked it 
as the most important form of professional growth. 
It was twice as important as the ability to take on new responsibilities, 
and more than 4x more important than chances to develop soft skills.

62% of developers in individual contributor roles want to become a technical 
lead in the next three years. That’s a stark contrast to the number that want 
to become managers (15%). 
It may be part of why most developers prioritize learning new tech skills 
when it comes to professional growth (versus taking on more responsibility 
or soft skills advancement, for example). Most are less interested in 
managing people, and more interested in filling a technical lead role, like a 
principal architect—so picking up new technical skills is paramount.
On the flip side, developers currently acting as managers and technical leads 
were pleased with their current roles. Most wanted to stay in the same role 
down the line.

HackerRank conducted its third annual developer skills survey to identify trends in the 
developer community. A total of 116,648 developers and students responded to the 
15-minute online survey from November 12 to December 11, 2019. The survey was 
programmed in SurveyMonkey and HackerRank recruited respondents via email 
(community members, customers, and prospects) and through social media sites. 
Respondents came from 162 countries. Results were analyzed using Q Research. Tests 
of significant differences were conducted at the .05 level (95% probability that the difference 
is real, not by chance). Percentages may not always add to 100% due to rounding.
